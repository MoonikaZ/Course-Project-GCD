###Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera - Programming Assignment

The goal of this project is prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Data that the project is based on comes from the accelerometer from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.
Original data can be obtained from:  
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The main objectives of the Coursera project were:  
  
1.	Mergeing the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.	Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3.	Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4.	Appropriate labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5.	From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  


Required tasks were carried out and their results are includes the following files:

    1. "Readme.md"
    2. "CodeBook.md" (contains description of the R code)
    3. "run_analysis.R" (R code used in the data manipulation)
